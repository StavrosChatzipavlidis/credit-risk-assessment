In this thesis, I explore the challenges of predicting loan defaults, particularly in the context of highly imbalanced datasets where the minority class is crucial due to the high costs associated with misclassifications, especially false negatives. I adopt a cost-sensitive approach using class weighting to enhance model performance.

To quantify the impact of my methods, I introduce a custom scoring function that assigns different costs to true negatives and false negatives, aiming to maximize overall profitability. I evaluate several models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and advanced algorithms like CatBoost and XGBoost.

The results demonstrate a significant improvement in classifying the minority class and a remarkable increase in profitability, highlighting the effectiveness of my approach in addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance.
